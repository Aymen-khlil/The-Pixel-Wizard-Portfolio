<h2 align="center">✨ The Pixel Wizard Portfolio ✨</h2>

<p align="center">
  Magical Front-End Portfolio — Pixel Art • Fantasy UI • Next.js

This is my personal portfolio, designed as an interactive wizarding workspace where every element feels alive.
Instead of a traditional UI, the project uses custom pixel art, enchanted animations, and narrative-style interactions to create an immersive environment for users exploring my skills, work, and contact section.

✨ Highlights

Fantasy UI Design: scroll-based inputs, wax-sealed buttons, glowing runes, animated owls, parchment textures, magical particles.

“Send an Owl” Contact System:

Custom form styled as a parchment scroll

Interactive wax-seal submit button (Framer Motion)

Owl-delivery success animation with Bezier-path motion

Error messages themed as Sorting Hat-style dialogue

Pixel Art Everywhere: handcrafted icons, backgrounds, house-themed owls, magical borders & illustrations.

Modern Stack: Next.js • React • TypeScript • Tailwind • Framer Motion • Zustand.

Accessible & Responsive: graceful HTML fallback, keyboard navigation, screen-reader-friendly labels.

🎯 Purpose

This project showcases my skills as a Front-End Developer with a strong focus on:

UI/UX design

creative animations

reusable components

clean architecture

modern web development best-practices

It also reflects my ability to create unique, polished, and memorable digital experiences — not just simple interfaces.
